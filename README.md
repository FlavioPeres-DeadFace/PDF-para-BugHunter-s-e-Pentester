# PDF-para-BugHunter-s-e-Pentester

This repository was created with some PDF files, for those people who are starting out in both PENTEST and BUGBOUNTY.

Remembering that PDFs like these can be found on the internet with a little research. But for greater ease I decided to combine them and separate them into sections.
